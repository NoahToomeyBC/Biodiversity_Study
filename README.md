# Bio Diversity In Different Belly Buttons

### In this project, we we're given a data set containing results and metrics from a scientific study that looked at the levels of bio-diversity in different types of belly buttons across a wide range of people. Using plotly, we were able to create interactive charts from the data set that show a visual representation of the data set which will allow researchers to better grasp the large data set that they had created. The [site](https://noahtoomeybc.github.io/Biodiversity_Study/) allows for users to interact with the data set by choosing which subject to examine as well as capture certain data points within the graphs themselves. CSS and bootstrap stylings were applied to make the website more visually pleasing as well as allow for all the charts to be displayed at once after a dataset has been selected.
